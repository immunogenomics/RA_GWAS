# Overview
We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which includes 276,020 samples of five ancestral groups. We included 37 cohorts comprising 35,871 RA patients and 240,149 control individuals of EUR, EAS, AFR, SAS, and ARB ancestry (Figure 1a). PCA and UMAP analysis confirmed that participants included representation of many of the 1KG Phase 3 ancestries.

## Main achievements in this GWAS
- We identified 124 significant loci, of which 34 were novel.
- Trans-ethnic fine mapping identified putatively causal variants with biological insights (e.g., LEF1) and less than ten 95% credible sets at 43 loci.
- Candidate genes at the novel loci suggested essential roles of the immune system (e.g., TNIP2 and TNFRSF11A) and joint tissues (e.g., WISP1) in RA etiology.
- PRS based on trans-ancestry GWAS outperformed PRS based on single-ancestry GWAS and had a comparable performance between European and East Asian populations.
